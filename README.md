# Visualization in Plotly
### Median income data from *US Census Bureau* was analyzed in Python (using *pandas*, & *numpy*)and visualized using *plotly.express*. Embeded URLs from figures generated were made using *chart_studio* 

**Questions Explored**: How did Median income change across various race from 2002 - 2021? Did COVID affect the median income? 

The data comprised of a larger response from White people, folowed by Hispanics, Blacks, Asians and Native Americans. Hispanics, Asians and Native American populations for the survey doubled from 2002 - 2021. Despite populations doubling, the percentage of people earning for each brackets Under $100K remained relatively the same. Asians were the only race where the percentage for 'Under $15K' income bracket decreased significantly from 2002 - 2021. The percentages for all Races increased in the over $200K income bracket, though some more than others.

With the start of COVID in 2019, all Races decreased in their incomes in 2020 across majority of income brackets. This was more strongly observed in the middle - upper income brackets (>$50K).
